$ weird test but ok

fun check_array_spill(): nothing
    var a : int[1];
    var b : int;
{
    b <- 0;
    a[1] <- 1; $ this should spill to variable b, since a, b are defined contiguously in a structure
    
    if (b # 1) then {
        writeString("Error: structs should allow spilling from array to variables defined contiguously in structs (just like C does)\n");
    }
}
