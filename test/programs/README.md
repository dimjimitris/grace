## Test File Format

The test files should follow the format `program{x}_{y}.grc`, where:
- `x` indicates whether the test should have errors or not:
  - `0` if the test should have no errors.
  - `1` if the test has errors.
- `y` is the identifying number of the test.

For example:
- `program0_1.grc` is a test file with no errors and the identifying number 1.
- `program1_2.grc` is a test file with errors and the identifying number 2.
