# OCaml Compiler for grace programming language

to compile run _dune build_ in root directory
to run a test (e.g. lexer.ml) run _dune exec test/lexer.exe <input_file>_ from the root directory after building the project

_misc_ is a folder of random stuff I have tried.
The actual code that is working is in the _lib_ directory.
