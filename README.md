# OCaml Compiler for grace programming language

to compile run `dune build` in root directory
to run a test (e.g. lexer.ml) run `dune exec test/lexer.exe <input_file>` from the root directory after building the project

`misc` is a folder of random stuff I have tried.
The actual code that is working is in the `lib` directory.
